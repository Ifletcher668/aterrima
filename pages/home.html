			<p>Aterrima, (pronounced A-terre-eh-mah) references the darkest shade of black, with which unparalleled affliction, sorrow, and pain is frequently associated. Our world, our current way of life, won’t be around forever. Aterrima's work is as stewards. We seek to invoke Nature by destabilizing humanities anthropocentric past to ensure a universally connected future.
<br>We believe that a new balance can be achieved, but that it, like the art of music itself, requires dynamic vigilance and effortless change. The themes woven into Aterrima’s music are largely centered around the imbalance humankind imparts on our natural world. Drawing from metal’s darkness, aggression and complexity, Aterrima’s eclectic, experimental approach to music incorporates near-endless influence and exploration. From Boise, Idaho, Aterrima formed in August, 2017. The band is backed by over a decade of music performance, study and composition.
